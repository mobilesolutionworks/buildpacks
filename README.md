# Buildpacks

This README outlines the utilization of buildpacks for creating non-web products.

The focus is on leveraging buildpacks to ensure consistent build environments, addressing the challenge of environmental
changes during release and deployment processes. By finalizing the build environment as an image, it facilitates the
product's re-release, potentially to varied repositories, thereby enhancing deployment consistency and reliability.
